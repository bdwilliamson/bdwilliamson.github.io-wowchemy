      <title>A multi-view model for relative and absolute microbial abundances</title>
      <link>https://bdwilliamson.github.io/publication/preprint/paramedic/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this work, we propose a statistical method for combining inexpensive
(but often lower-quality) estimates of relative abundance (e.g.,
collected using universal primers for the 16S rRNA gene) and higher
quality (but often expensive) estimates of absolute abundance (e.g.,
from quantitative PCR) to estimate absolute abundance of all taxa.
Crucially, our proposal accounts for differences in the efficiency of
taxon detection in the relative and absolute abundance data. This is

      <title>Adaptive non-inferiority margins under observable non-constancy</title>
      <link>https://bdwilliamson.github.io/publication/journal-article/ni-margins/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In settings where it is not ethical to perform a classical
placebo-controlled trial, new interventions must be evaluated against
the standard of care. Non-inferiority trials are often used to evaluate
new interventions in this context. Here, the goal is for the
experimental intervention to be “not unacceptably worse” than the
standard of care, so that there are an increased number of viable
intervention options. A common assumption in non-inferiority trials is
that the active control population (typically receiving standard of
care) is similar to the populations in prior placebo-controlled
randomized trials. However, if characteristics in the current trial
differ from previous trials – for example, adherence to the active
control regimen is lesser or greater than planned – then the chance of a
false positive result (type I error) or a false negative result (type II
error) can be different than planned. In this work, we proposed a method
for rigorously adapting a non-inferiority trial based on observed
characteristics of the active control participants. This is joint work

      <title>Frequency and predictors of estimated HIV transmissions and bacterial STI acquisition among HIV‐positive patients in HIV care across three continents</title>
      <link>https://bdwilliamson.github.io/publication/journal-article/hptn-063/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 28 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;HPTN 063 was a clinical trial that aimed to examine potential HIV
transmissions and the frequency of bacterial sexually transmitted
infection (STI) acquisition among an international group of HIV-positive
individuals in HIV care. The long-term goal was to inform
treatment-as-prevention programs and provide ways of evaluating the
potential impact of such programs. We found that there were substantial
numbers of both estimated HIV transmissions and STIs, despite sampling
individuals in HIV care. This suggested that augmenting secondary
prevention interventions may be a means to decrease HIV incidence. This

      <title>Characteristics of Age-Discordant Partnerships Associated With HIV Risk Among Young South African Women (HPTN 068)</title>
      <link>https://bdwilliamson.github.io/publication/journal-article/hptn-068/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This study is based on data from the HIV Prevention Trials Network
(HPTN) trial 068. In this work, we aimed to identify factors associated
with age-discordant partnerships (one partner greater than 5 years older
than the other) and examine the association between partner age
discordance and HIV risk in young South African women. We found that a
history of age-discordant partnerships is associated witih greater odds
of reporting HIV risk factors. This is joint work with &lt;a href=&#34;https://fmch.duke.edu/profile/tiarney-ritchwood&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Tiarney
