# Research

I am interested in problems of high-dimensional data, data science, and statistical inference. In particular, I enjoy working on developing new methodology for addressing scientific questions using large and complex datasets, and appropriately quantifying uncertainty in the resulting estimates. I also enjoy working on problems involving how best to tell a story using data. I have been primarily motivated by applications in public health and medicine, but I am always open to collaborations on interesting problems in any area of research.

To date, I have been primarily focused on developing a unified, model-free framework for assessing variable importance. We leverage tools from both machine learning and targeted learning to efficiently estimate a statistical parameter of interest, and provide appropriate estimates of uncertainty.

### HIV prevention

#### Characteristics associated with HIV risk

This study is based on data from the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) trial 068. In this work, we aimed to identify factors associated with age-discordant partnerships (one partner greater than 5 years older than the other) and examine the association between partner age discordance and HIV risk in young South African women. We found that a history of age-discordant partnerships is associated witih greater odds of reporting HIV risk factors.

#### HIV Treatment as Prevention (TasP)

HPTN 063 was a clinical trial that aimed to examine potential HIV transmissions and the frequency of bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) acquisition among an international group of HIV-positive individuals in HIV care. The long-term goal was to inform TasP programs and provide ways of evaluating the potential impact of such programs. We found that there were substantial numbers of both estimated HIV transmissions and STIs, despite sampling individuals in HIV care. This suggested that augmenting secondary prevention interventions may be a means to decrease HIV incidence.

### Cancer treatment

#### Optimizing cancer treatment strategies using single-cell data

In this work, our goal was to develop an algorithm for optimally assigning patients to cancer treatment strategies. We leveraged data from single-cell mass cytometry to: automatically determine subpopulations of cells; create a nested effects model to infer gene hierarchy based on perturbation effects due to administered drugs; and create a scoring and ranking algorithm that identifies the minimal number of drugs among a combination of drugs with teh maximal desired intracellular effects.
