# Research

I am interested in problems of high-dimensional data, data science, and statistical inference. In particular, I enjoy working on developing new methodology for addressing scientific questions using large and complex datasets, and appropriately quantifying uncertainty in the resulting estimates. I also enjoy working on problems involving how best to tell a story using data. I have been primarily motivated by applications in public health and medicine, but I am always open to collaborations on interesting problems in any area of research.

To date, I have been primarily focused on developing a unified, model-free framework for assessing variable importance. We leverage tools from both machine learning and targeted learning to efficiently estimate a statistical parameter of interest, and provide appropriate estimates of uncertainty.
