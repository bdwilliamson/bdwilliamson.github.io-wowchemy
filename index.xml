      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this work, we propose a statistical method for combining inexpensive
(but often lower-quality) estimates of relative abundance (e.g.,
collected using universal primers for the 16S rRNA gene) and higher
quality (but often expensive) estimates of absolute abundance (e.g.,
from quantitative PCR) to estimate absolute abundance of all taxa.
Crucially, our proposal accounts for differences in the efficiency of
taxon detection in the relative and absolute abundance data. This is
joint work with

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is often of interest to understand the population interplay between
the outcome and measured covariates. Variable importance is a useful
tool towards this goal. Examples include: HIV vaccine studies,
correlates of risk analyses, and identifying patients at high risk of
returning to a hospital after discharge for heart failure. This is joint
work with

&lt;h2 id=&#34;correlates-of-hiv-1-risk&#34;&gt;Correlates of HIV-1 risk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we do not yet have a broadly efficacious vaccine against HIV-1,
clinical trials of HIV-1 vaccine candidates can identify potential
correlates of risk or of protection. These correlates are measurable
signs that a person is at risk of or is protected from infection by
HIV-1, respectively. In this work, I collaborated with Peter Gilbert and
others affiliated with the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hvtn.org/en.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;HIV Vaccine Trials
Network&lt;/a&gt; to analyze data from the

505&lt;/a&gt;
clinical trial. We identified three antibody features that inversely
correlated with HIV-1 infection risk. This may help in designing future
HIV-1 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;characteristics-associated-with-hiv-risk-in-young-south-african-women&#34;&gt;Characteristics associated with HIV risk in young South African women&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study is based on data from the HIV Prevention Trials Network
(HPTN) trial 068. In this work, we aimed to identify factors associated
with age-discordant partnerships (one partner greater than 5 years older
than the other) and examine the association between partner age
discordance and HIV risk in young South African women. We found that a
history of age-discordant partnerships is associated witih greater odds
of reporting HIV risk factors. This is joint work with

and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hiv-treatment-as-prevention&#34;&gt;HIV treatment as prevention&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HPTN 063 was a clinical trial that aimed to examine potential HIV
transmissions and the frequency of bacterial sexually transmitted
infection (STI) acquisition among an international group of HIV-positive
individuals in HIV care. The long-term goal was to inform
treatment-as-prevention programs and provide ways of evaluating the
potential impact of such programs. We found that there were substantial
numbers of both estimated HIV transmissions and STIs, despite sampling
individuals in HIV care. This suggested that augmenting secondary
prevention interventions may be a means to decrease HIV incidence. This

&lt;p&gt;In this work, our goal was to develop an algorithm for optimally
assigning patients to cancer treatment strategies. We leveraged data
from single-cell mass cytometry to: automatically determine
subpopulations of cells; create a nested effects model to infer gene
hierarchy based on perturbation effects due to administered drugs; and
create a scoring and ranking algorithm that identifies the minimal
number of drugs among a combination of drugs with teh maximal desired
intracellular effects. This is joint work with

      <title>Statistical Methods for Clinical Trials</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In settings where it is not ethical to perform a classical
placebo-controlled trial, new interventions must be evaluated against
the standard of care. Non-inferiority trials are often used to evaluate
new interventions in this context. Here, the goal is for the
experimental intervention to be “not unacceptably worse” than the
standard of care, so that there are an increased number of viable
intervention options. A common assumption in non-inferiority trials is
that the active control population (typically receiving standard of
care) is similar to the populations in prior placebo-controlled
randomized trials. However, if characteristics in the current trial
differ from previous trials – for example, adherence to the active
control regimen is lesser or greater than planned – then the chance of a
false positive result (type I error) or a false negative result (type II
error) can be different than planned. In this work, we proposed a method
for rigorously adapting a non-inferiority trial based on observed
characteristics of the active control participants. This is joint work
with 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fredhutch.org/en/labs/profiles/donnell-deborah.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Deborah

      <title>Broadly Neutralizing Antibodies</title>
      <link>https://bdwilliamson.github.io/project/bnabs/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 13 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The broadly neutralizing antibody VRC01, developed by the Vaccine
Research Center of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases, is currently being evaluated in the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ampstudy.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Antibody Mediated
Prevention&lt;/a&gt; study (AMP). While the primary goal
of AMP is to assess the preventative efficacy of VRC01, a key secondary
goal is to determine if this efficacy differs based on characteristics
of the HIV virus. There are many possible locations on the HIV genome
that we might be interested in; if we simply did a statistical test for
association at each possible location, and then appropriately accounted
for this multiple testing, then we would have low power to detect
effects. To prepare for AMP, we used data on HIV viruses from the

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/components/sequence/HIV/neutralization/main.comp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Compile, Neutralize, and Tally NAb
Panels&lt;/a&gt;
database. Our goals were to: (i) develop a score that performed well for
predicting whether or not an HIV virus was sensitive to neutralization
by VRC01, and (ii) to identify groups of HIV genome features that were
important in predicting neutralization sensitivity. This project is
joint work with 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/camagaret/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Craig Magaret&lt;/a&gt;,

and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We next extended the methods used for the VRC01 analysis to combinations
of antibodies – a prevention strategy involving multiple bnAbs is likely
to be much more effective than a strategy with a single bnAb. Sohail
Nizam joined the team for this project. The software is implemented as a
Docker container.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this work, we extended our approach from the R-squared variable importance measure to handle nonparametric extensions of many interesting measures, including the difference in classification accuracy, the difference in area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and the difference in deviance. We also propose a test for the null hypothesis of zero importance that has proper type I error control.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We first focused on a nonparametric extension of the classical measure based on the difference in R-squared (from linear models). We provide a simple approach for estimation that incorporates machine learning tools, and yields valid confidence intervals for the true importance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Frequency and predictors of estimated HIV transmissions and bacterial STI acquisition among HIV‐positive patients in HIV care across three continents</title>
      <link>https://bdwilliamson.github.io/publication/journal-article/hptn-063/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;HPTN 063 was a clinical trial that aimed to examine potential HIV
transmissions and the frequency of bacterial sexually transmitted
infection (STI) acquisition among an international group of HIV-positive
individuals in HIV care. The long-term goal was to inform
treatment-as-prevention programs and provide ways of evaluating the
potential impact of such programs. We found that there were substantial
numbers of both estimated HIV transmissions and STIs, despite sampling
individuals in HIV care. This suggested that augmenting secondary
prevention interventions may be a means to decrease HIV incidence. This

      <title>Characteristics of Age-Discordant Partnerships Associated With HIV Risk Among Young South African Women (HPTN 068)</title>
      <link>https://bdwilliamson.github.io/publication/journal-article/hptn-068/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This study is based on data from the HIV Prevention Trials Network
(HPTN) trial 068. In this work, we aimed to identify factors associated
with age-discordant partnerships (one partner greater than 5 years older
than the other) and examine the association between partner age
discordance and HIV risk in young South African women. We found that a
history of age-discordant partnerships is associated witih greater odds
of reporting HIV risk factors. This is joint work with

&lt;p&gt;I am a postdoctoral fellow in the

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Fred Hutch&lt;/a&gt;, where I work with

Huang&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I completed my doctoral studies in

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.biostat.washington.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Biostatistics&lt;/a&gt; at the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washington.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;University
of Washington&lt;/a&gt; under the guidance of

&lt;p&gt;I am interested in problems of high-dimensional data, data science, and
statistical inference. In particular, I enjoy working on developing new
methodology for addressing scientific questions using large and complex
datasets, and appropriately quantifying uncertainty in the resulting
estimates. I also enjoy working on problems involving how best to tell a
story using data. I have been primarily motivated by applications in
public health and medicine, but I am always open to collaborations on
interesting problems in any area of research.&lt;/p&gt;
