These correlates are measurable signs that a person is at risk of or is protected from infection by HIV-1, respectively. In this work, I collaborated with Peter Gilbert and others affiliated with the HIV Vaccine Trials Network to analyze data from the HVTN 505 clinical trial. We identified three antibody features that inversely correlated with HIV-1 infection risk. This may help in designing future HIV-1 vaccines.\nNon-vaccine HIV prevention Characteristics associated with HIV risk in young South African women This study is based on data from the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) trial 068. In this work, we aimed to identify factors associated with age-discordant partnerships (one partner greater than 5 years older than the other) and examine the association between partner age discordance and HIV risk in young South African women. We found that a history of age-discordant partnerships is associated witih greater odds of reporting HIV risk factors. This is joint work with Tiarney Ritchwood, Jim Hughes, and others.\nHIV treatment as prevention HPTN 063 was a clinical trial that aimed to examine potential HIV transmissions and the frequency of bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) acquisition among an international group of HIV-positive individuals in HIV care. The long-term goal was to inform treatment-as-prevention programs and provide ways of evaluating the potential impact of such programs. We found that there were substantial numbers of both estimated HIV transmissions and STIs, despite sampling individuals in HIV care. This suggested that augmenting secondary prevention interventions may be a means to decrease HIV incidence. This is joint work with Steven Safren, Jim Hughes, and others.\nCancer treatment Optimizing cancer treatment strategies using single-cell data In this work, our goal was to develop an algorithm for optimally assigning patients to cancer treatment strategies. We leveraged data from single-cell mass cytometry to: automatically determine subpopulations of cells; create a nested effects model to infer gene hierarchy based on perturbation effects due to administered drugs; and create a scoring and ranking algorithm that identifies the minimal number of drugs among a combination of drugs with teh maximal desired intracellular effects.

Non-inferiority trials are often used to evaluate new interventions in this context. Here, the goal is for the experimental intervention to be “not unacceptably worse” than the standard of care, so that there are an increased number of viable intervention options. A common assumption in non-inferiority trials is that the active control population (typically receiving standard of care) is similar to the populations in prior placebo-controlled randomized trials. However, if characteristics in the current trial differ from previous trials – for example, adherence to the active control regimen is lesser or greater than planned – then the chance of a false positive result (type I error) or a false negative result (type II error) can be different than planned.

While the primary goal of AMP is to assess the preventative efficacy of VRC01, a key secondary goal is to determine if this efficacy differs based on characteristics of the HIV virus. There are many possible locations on the HIV genome that we might be interested in; if we simply did a statistical test for association at each possible location, and then appropriately accounted for this multiple testing, then we would have low power to detect effects. To prepare for AMP, we used data on HIV viruses from the Compile, Neutralize, and Tally NAb Panels database. Our goals were to: (i) develop a score that performed well for predicting whether or not an HIV virus was sensitive to neutralization by VRC01, and (ii) to identify groups of HIV genome features that were important in predicting neutralization sensitivity. This project is joint work with Craig Magaret, David Benkeser, Peter Gilbert, and others.\nWe next extended the methods used for the VRC01 analysis to combinations of antibodies – a prevention strategy involving multiple bnAbs is likely to be much more effective than a strategy with a single bnAb.

We found that there were substantial numbers of both estimated HIV transmissions and STIs, despite sampling individuals in HIV care. This suggested that augmenting secondary prevention interventions may be a means to decrease HIV incidence. This is joint work with Steven Safren, Jim Hughes, and others.\n","date":1475020800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1475020800,"objectID":"dab087efb04d8682eaea22331b71b0f5","permalink":"https://bdwilliamson.github.io/publication/journal-article/hptn-063/","publishdate":"2020-07-13T13:38:54-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/hptn-063/","section":"publication","summary":"The primary analysis of the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 063 trial.","tags":["clinical-trials","infectious-diseases","collaborative-science"],"title":"Frequency and predictors of estimated HIV transmissions and bacterial STI acquisition among HIV‐positive patients in HIV care across three continents","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tiarney Ritchwood","Jim Hughes","Larissa Jennings","Catherine MacPhail","Brian Williamson","et al."],"categories":["collaborative-science"],"content":"This study is based on data from the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) trial 068. In this work, we aimed to identify factors associated with age-discordant partnerships (one partner greater than 5 years older than the other) and examine the association between partner age discordance and HIV risk in young South African women. We found that a history of age-discordant partnerships is associated witih greater odds of reporting HIV risk factors.
