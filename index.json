While the primary goal of AMP is to assess the preventative efficacy of VRC01, a key secondary goal is to determine if this efficacy differs based on characteristics of the HIV virus. There are many possible locations on the HIV genome that we might be interested in; if we simply did a statistical test for association at each possible location, and then appropriately accounted for this multiple testing, then we would have low power to detect effects. To prepare for AMP, we used data on HIV viruses from the Compile, Neutralize, and Tally NAb Panels database. Our goals were to: (i) develop a score that performed well for predicting whether or not an HIV virus was sensitive to neutralization by VRC01, and (ii) to identify groups of HIV genome features that were important in predicting neutralization sensitivity. This project is joint work with Craig Magaret, David Benkeser, Peter Gilbert, and others.\nWe next extended the methods used for the VRC01 analysis to combinations of antibodies – a prevention strategy involving multiple bnAbs is likely to be much more effective than a strategy with a single bnAb. Sohail Nizam joined the team for this project. The software is implemented as a Docker container.\n","date":1594598400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610760676,"objectID":"9f53be88fd5b94471c2474554b586245","permalink":"https://bdwilliamson.github.io/project/bnabs/","publishdate":"2020-07-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/bnabs/","section":"project","summary":"Assessing neutralization sensitivity of HIV-1 viruses to broadly neutralizing antibodies.","tags":["variable-importance","machine-learning","biostatistics","infectious-diseases","semiparametric-inference"],"title":"Broadly Neutralizing Antibodies","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"HIV vaccines Correlates of HIV-1 risk While we do not yet have a broadly efficacious vaccine against HIV-1, clinical trials of HIV-1 vaccine candidates can identify potential correlates of risk or of protection. These correlates are measurable signs that a person is at risk of or is protected from infection by HIV-1, respectively. In this work, I collaborated with Peter Gilbert and others affiliated with the HIV Vaccine Trials Network to analyze data from the HVTN 505 clinical trial. We identified three antibody features that inversely correlated with HIV-1 infection risk. This may help in designing future HIV-1 vaccines.\nSurrogate endpoints for cytomegalovirus disease We used a combination of classical statistical methods and ensemble-based machine learning to assess various viral load kinetics as potential surrogate endpoints for cytomegalovirus disease after transplant. We found that mean, peak, and change in viral load over the first five weeks of treatment fulfilled the Prentice criteria for surrogacy and captured a large proportion of the treatment effect in two randomized, controlled trials.\nNon-vaccine HIV prevention Characteristics associated with HIV risk in young South African women This study is based on data from the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) trial 068. In this work, we aimed to identify factors associated with age-discordant partnerships (one partner greater than 5 years older than the other) and examine the association between partner age discordance and HIV risk in young South African women. We found that a history of age-discordant partnerships is associated witih greater odds of reporting HIV risk factors. This is joint work with Tiarney Ritchwood, Jim Hughes, and others.\nHIV treatment as prevention HPTN 063 was a clinical trial that aimed to examine potential HIV transmissions and the frequency of bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) acquisition among an international group of HIV-positive individuals in HIV care. The long-term goal was to inform treatment-as-prevention programs and provide ways of evaluating the potential impact of such programs. We found that there were substantial numbers of both estimated HIV transmissions and STIs, despite sampling individuals in HIV care. This suggested that augmenting secondary prevention interventions may be a means to decrease HIV incidence. This is joint work with Steven Safren, Jim Hughes, and others.\nCancer treatment Optimizing cancer treatment strategies using single-cell data In this work, our goal was to develop an algorithm for optimally assigning patients to cancer treatment strategies. We leveraged data from single-cell mass cytometry to: automatically determine subpopulations of cells; create a nested effects model to infer gene hierarchy based on perturbation effects due to administered drugs; and create a scoring and ranking algorithm that identifies the minimal number of drugs among a combination of drugs with teh maximal desired intracellular effects. This is joint work with Sylvia Plevritis, Benedict Anchang, and others.\n","date":1594598400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610760676,"objectID":"a64bf01656b207ed39a101bbb76c79b9","permalink":"https://bdwilliamson.github.io/project/collaborative-science/","publishdate":"2020-07-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/collaborative-science/","section":"project","summary":"Collaborative projects across multiple disease areas.","tags":["infectious-diseases","collaborative-science"],"title":"Collaborative Science","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"  ","date":1594598400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609957506,"objectID":"3450b1eaed40687388bbffb5939536d3","permalink":"https://bdwilliamson.github.io/talk/efficient-nonparametric-statistical-inference-on-population-feature-importance-using-shapley-values/","publishdate":"2020-07-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/efficient-nonparametric-statistical-inference-on-population-feature-importance-using-shapley-values/","section":"event","summary":"We discuss our paper to be published in the *Proceedings of the Thirty-seventh International Conference on Machine Learning*.","tags":["variable-importance","machine-learning"],"title":"Efficient nonparametric statistical inference on population feature importance using Shapley values","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In this work, we propose a statistical method for combining inexpensive (but often lower-quality) estimates of relative abundance (e.g., collected using universal primers for the 16S rRNA gene) and higher quality (but often expensive) estimates of absolute abundance (e.g., from quantitative PCR) to estimate absolute abundance of all taxa.

This is joint work with Deborah Donnell, Brett Hanscom, and Jim Hughes.\n","date":1538956800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609954077,"objectID":"c512223bc7b556ed1788cdf3d1be9f16","permalink":"https://bdwilliamson.github.io/publication/journal-article/ni-margins/","publishdate":"2020-07-13T13:38:19-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/ni-margins/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose a statistical method for rigorously adapting the non-inferiority margin in non-inferiority clinical trials subject to non-constancy.","tags":[],"title":"Adaptive non-inferiority margins under observable non-constancy","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1536969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609957506,"objectID":"3c2251cb60b42501fb24d32ace5d314a","permalink":"https://bdwilliamson.github.io/talk/assessing-variable-importance-nonparametrically-using-machine-learning-techniques/","publishdate":"2020-07-13T17:11:53-07:00","relpermalink":"/talk/assessing-variable-importance-nonparametrically-using-machine-learning-techniques/","section":"event","summary":"Invited talk on my dissertation research given at the UW Biostatistics Colloquium","tags":["variable-importance","machine-learning"],"title":"Assessing variable importance nonparametrically using machine learning techniques","type":"event"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1533081600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609957506,"objectID":"6d1d64204426a85ba90167bf1e8f142b","permalink":"https://bdwilliamson.github.io/talk/assessing-variable-importance-nonparametrically-using-machine-learning-techniques/","publishdate":"2020-07-13T17:11:31-07:00","relpermalink":"/talk/assessing-variable-importance-nonparametrically-using-machine-learning-techniques/","section":"event","summary":"This talk (at JSM 2018) was selected for an ASA Biometrics Section Travel Award","tags":["variable-importance","machine-learning"],"title":"Assessing variable importance nonparametrically using machine learning techniques","type":"event"},{"authors":["Jean Feng","Brian Williamson","Marco Carone","Noah Simon"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1531612800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609954077,"objectID":"8d14d3d6c241ccb0aaf64a1129a084ce","permalink":"https://bdwilliamson.github.io/publication/conference-paper/nnet/","publishdate":"2020-07-13T13:37:30-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/conference-paper/nnet/","section":"publication","summary":"We show how a single augmented neural network with multi-task learning simultaneously estimates the importance of many feature subsets, improving on previous procedures for estimating importance.","tags":[],"title":"Nonparametric variable importance using an augmented neural network with multi-task learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1531180800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609957506,"objectID":"7128161b3ba3b66abb725859c1ebf27f","permalink":"https://bdwilliamson.github.io/talk/nonparametric-variable-importance-using-an-augmented-neural-network-with-multi-task-learning/","publishdate":"2020-07-13T17:11:17-07:00","relpermalink":"/talk/nonparametric-variable-importance-using-an-augmented-neural-network-with-multi-task-learning/","section":"event","summary":"Contributed talk at the Thirty-fifth International Conference on Machine Learning","tags":["variable-importance","machine-learning"],"title":"Nonparametric variable importance using an augmented neural network with multi-task learning","type":"event"},{"authors":["Benedict Anchang","Kara Davis","Harris Feinberg","Brian Williamson","et al."],"categories":null,"content":"In this work, our goal was to develop an algorithm for optimally assigning patients to cancer treatment strategies.
