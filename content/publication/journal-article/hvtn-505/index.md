While we do not yet have a broadly efficacious vaccine against HIV-1,
clinical trials of HIV-1 vaccine candidates can identify potential
correlates of risk or of protection. These correlates are measurable
signs that a person is at risk of or is protected from infection by
HIV-1, respectively. In this work, I collaborated with Peter Gilbert and
others affiliated with the [HIV Vaccine Trials
Network](https://www.hvtn.org/en.html) to analyze data from the [HVTN
505](https://www.hvtn.org/en/community/community-compass/vol19-issue1/hvtn-505-recap.html)
clinical trial. We identified three antibody features that inversely
correlated with HIV-1 infection risk. This may help in designing future
HIV-1 vaccines.
