This study is based on data from the HIV Prevention Trials Network
(HPTN) trial 068. In this work, we aimed to identify factors associated
with age-discordant partnerships (one partner greater than 5 years older
than the other) and examine the association between partner age
discordance and HIV risk in young South African women. We found that a
history of age-discordant partnerships is associated witih greater odds
of reporting HIV risk factors. This is joint work with [Tiarney
Ritchwood](https://fmch.duke.edu/profile/tiarney-ritchwood), Jim Hughes,
and others.
