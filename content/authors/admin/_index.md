Pronouns: he/him/his

I am a postdoctoral fellow in the [Vaccine and Infectious Disease
Division](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/research/divisions/vaccine-infectious-disease-division.html)
at [Fred Hutch](https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html), where I work with
[Ying
Huang](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/faculty-lab-directory/huang-ying.html).

I completed my doctoral studies in
[Biostatistics](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/) at the [University
of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) under the guidance of [Marco
Carone](http://faculty.washington.edu/mcarone/about.html) and [Noah
Simon](http://faculty.washington.edu/nrsimon/).

I am interested in problems of high-dimensional data, data science, and
statistical inference. In particular, I enjoy working on developing new
methodology for addressing scientific questions using large and complex
datasets, and appropriately quantifying uncertainty in the resulting
estimates. I also enjoy working on problems involving how best to tell a
story using data. I have been primarily motivated by applications in
public health and medicine, but I am always open to collaborations on
interesting problems in any area of research.
