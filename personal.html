<p>During my time at Pomona College, I was a four year member of the <a href="http://sagehens.com/sports/mswimdive/index">Pomona-Pitzer Swimming and Diving team</a>, which I captained my senior year. I still enjoy swimming, and generally swim with the <a href="http://www.huskymasters.org/">Husky Masters</a> team from September to June. </p>
<p>Recently I have gotten much more into hiking and backpacking, mostly in the Pacific Northwest (<a href="https://www.nps.gov/olym/index.htm">Olympic National Park</a>, <a href="https://www.recreation.gov/wildernessAreaDetails.do?contractCode=NRSO&amp;parkId=72280">the Enchantments</a>, and <a href="https://www.nps.gov/mora/index.htm">Mount Ranier National Park</a> are some favorites). I have done some great trips elsewhere in the US West &#8201;&mdash;&#8201; <a href="https://www.recreation.gov/wildernessAreaDetails.do?contractCode=NRSO&amp;parkId=72202">Desolation Wilderness</a> (near Lake Tahoe, CA), and <a href="https://www.nps.gov/arch/index.htm">Arches</a> and <a href="https://www.nps.gov/cany/index.htm">Canyonlands</a> National Parks near Moab, UT. </p>
<p>In any extra free time, I enjoy reading and listening to music on vinyl (which means that I also spend an inordinate amount of time cleaning and polishing records).</p>
<p>My sister is also a statistician: she received her BA in Mathematics from Pomona College, and currently works for a famous baseball team on the US East Coast.</p>
<p>Check out my <a href="http://alexlincoln.weebly.com/">partner's website</a> if you want to learn more about the relationship between bears and salmon in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska &#8201;&mdash;&#8201; specifically, she studies consumption patterns and the interplay between bear consumption, nutrient cycling, and the health of riparian ecosystems</p>
