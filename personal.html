<h1>Personal</h1>
</div>
<p>During my time at Pomona College, I was a four year member of the <a href="http://sagehens.com/sports/mswimdive/index">Pomona-Pitzer Swimming and Diving team</a>, which I captained my senior year. I still enjoy swimming, and generally swim with the <a href="http://www.huskymasters.org/">Husky Masters</a> team from September to June. </p>
<p>Recently I have gotten much more into hiking and backpacking, mostly in the Pacific Northwest (Olympic National Park, the Enchantments, Mount Ranier National Park are some favorites). I have done some great trips elsewhere in the US West &#8201;&mdash;&#8201; Desolation Wilderness (near Lake Tahoe, CA), and Arches and Canyonlands National Parks near Moab, UT. </p>
<p>In any extra free time, I enjoy reading and listening to music on vinyl (which means that I also spend an inordinate amount of time cleaning and polishing records).</p>
<p>My sister is also a statistician: she received her BA in Mathematics from Pomona College, and currently is working with the New York Yankees in the Analytics team.</p>
<p>Check out my partner's website if you want to learn more about bears and salmon in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska.</p>
<p>This page is still currently under development</p>
