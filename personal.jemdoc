During my time at Pomona College, I was a four year member of the [http://sagehens.com/sports/mswimdive/index Pomona-Pitzer Swimming and Diving team], which I captained my senior year. I still enjoy swimming, and generally swim with the [http://www.huskymasters.org/ Husky Masters] team from September to June. 

Recently I have gotten much more into hiking and backpacking, mostly in the Pacific Northwest ([https://www.nps.gov/olym/index.htm Olympic National Park], [https://www.recreation.gov/wildernessAreaDetails.do?contractCode=NRSO&parkId=72280 the Enchantments], and [https://www.nps.gov/mora/index.htm Mount Ranier National Park] are some favorites). I have done some great trips elsewhere in the US West --- [https://www.recreation.gov/wildernessAreaDetails.do?contractCode=NRSO&parkId=72202 Desolation Wilderness] (near Lake Tahoe, CA), and [https://www.nps.gov/arch/index.htm Arches] and [https://www.nps.gov/cany/index.htm Canyonlands] National Parks near Moab, UT. 

In any extra free time, I enjoy reading and listening to music on vinyl (which means that I also spend an inordinate amount of time cleaning and polishing records).

My sister is also a statistician: she received her BA in Mathematics from Pomona College, and currently works for a famous baseball team on the US East Coast.
