I'm currently a fourth-year PhD student in the [https://www.biostat.washington.edu/ Department of Biostatistics] at the [https://www.washington.edu/ University of Washington].

My dissertation work is with [http://faculty.washington.edu/mcarone/about.html Marco Carone] and [http://faculty.washington.edu/nrsimon/ Noah Simon]. We develop nonparametric methods for possibly high-dimensional data, with applications in HIV/AIDS.

My RA work is with [http://faculty.washington.edu/jphughes/ Jim Hughes], [https://www.fredhutch.org/en/labs/profiles/donnell-deborah.html Deborah Donnell], and [https://www.fredhutch.org/en/labs/profiles/hanscom-brett.html Brett Hanscom]. We work on methods for rigorously adapting non-inferiority margins under observable non-constancy, particularly in HIV prevention clinical trials.
