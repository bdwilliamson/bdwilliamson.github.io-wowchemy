![](grad_photo_straight_medium.jpg)

I'm currently a PhD candidate in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/).

My dissertation work is with [Marco Carone](http://faculty.washington.edu/mcarone/about.html) and [Noah Simon](http://faculty.washington.edu/nrsimon/). We develop nonparametric methods for possibly high-dimensional data. For more information about this and other projects that I am involved in, check out my [Research Page](research.html).

Check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/bdwilliamson), [CV](cv.html) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianwilliamson26/). Please [contact me](contact.html) if you have questions about my projects or want to collaborate.
